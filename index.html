    <h3>Personality</h3><br>
    <p>
    Fubuki is usually always cheerful and excited, singing little songs and making many in-jokes. She is shy when
    confronted with new circumstances, and when embarrassed she "hides" at the bottom of the screen with only her fox
    ears peeking up. She becomes enthralled in games and has cute conversations with scripted game characters, or voice
    acts as characters while making effects.
    However, she has a cunning, ruthless and twisted side to her, shown most often when playing "Project Winter" with
    other VTubers. She has described herself as a 'hunter' and has displayed both extreme skill, to the point of nearly
    winning a 1 v 4 battle all on her own, as well as a methodical thought process. <br><br> For example, during a
    "Project Winter" stream, Fubuki collaborated with fellow in-game traitors to purposely line up her shots at a wolf
    with Matsuri in an attempt to kill her early and make it look like an accident.[7] And when playing Undertale, she
    started the G-route first and was rather sarcastic/apathetic towards Flowey begging for his life, something most
    players usually feel bad about the G-route. She also stole "Human" meat in Minecraft and crafted them into "Friend"
    meat with a wide smile on her face.
    Fubuki is one to fearlessly march to the beat of her own drum, sometimes to a career risking degree. <br><br> For
    example, she has once said that if hololive forced her to say something she didn't want to on stream, she would
    rather quit her job. And in another instance, she decided to call Roberu on his stream without care, which is a huge
    risk to any idol, real or virtual, due to followers potentially attacking her for "tainting her purity" by talking
    to a boy (among other "noble fan" nonsense).
    She greets her viewers with "Kon Kon Kitsune!".

                    href="#cite_note-holotalk-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> Her nickname in that game is, Fox Burger King,
            which spells FBK, an abbreviation for Fubuki. Since then, she is usually depicted on her streams loading
            screens as a pixel sprite carefreely eating a burger while wearing a crown.</li>
        <li>The English-speaking audience sometimes refer to Fubuki as Friend, and her fans as Friends. This relates to
            a video where an English-speaking user asked Fubuki to be their wife, to which she responded by saying she
            would instead be their friend.<sup id="cite_ref-friend_45-0" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-friend-45">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup></li>
        <li>Corn sometimes appears in Fubuki's content. This a pun on "kon", the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound
            made by a fox.</li>

        <li>Fubuki pays close attention to her kouhai's streams. She often watches hololive streams as a way to
            relax.<sup id="cite_ref-holotalk_40-3" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-holotalk-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup></li>
        <li>Fubuki is a workaholic, and almost never takes breaks. In 2020, she took a one-week holiday at management's
            insistence, her first holiday since her debut.<sup id="cite_ref-holotalk_40-4" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-holotalk-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup></li>
        <li>She is not good with the English language. Her introductory video had the English version of her name
            misspelled as "Fhunbuki".</li>
        <li>Just like her fellow hololive VTuber <a href="/wiki/Hoshimachi_Suisei" title="Hoshimachi Suisei">Hoshimachi
                Suisei</a>, Fubuki has shown a fond liking towards young boys. This has culminated in her writing
            multiple poems about watching Shotas in the rain, watching Shotas at the pool, and watching Shotas at the
            ice cream shop, all on Ookami Mio's competitive Haiku stream,<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a
                    href="#cite_note-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> much to Suisei's chagrin.</li>
        <li>She is the fourteenth hololive member to join the official Hololive Subreddit as a moderator.</li>
        <li>Fubuki introduced many non-Japanese viewers to hololive, including Takanashi Kiara. Kiara once sang Fubuki's
            song on stream, Fubuki promised to return the favor by performing Kiara's song once she reaches 1 million
            subscribers.<sup id="cite_ref-holotalk_40-5" class="reference"><a
